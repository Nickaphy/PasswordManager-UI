# PasswordManager-UI WINDOWS
Master username: Admin
Master password: 123

This is my first release of my UI based passwordmanager, 
it is not yet encrypted and the passwords are stored in a .txt file in the assets folder which is created
when the setup button is clicked.

Use:
First unpack the folder
When you first load up the program type in the master password and username you will have to run the setup function
then close the program and open again boom then its ready for use.
